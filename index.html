<p>
The Pigout had a great turnout of 43 individuals.
Attendees had a fun time, and of course, there was lunch ordered from
and setup by Armadillo Willy's staff. Gift cards were given to all after lunch.
Jackie Fenton, USTA player and owner of <a href="http://www.brightheartyogastudio.com" target="_blank">
Brightheart Yoga Studio</a>, gave a 
demonstration on how to warmup correctly, to safeguard oneself from injury.
The high scores went to Volga Cavello and Trevor McGuire.
Many thanks to all who helped setup the tables,chairs and then put them away-
and especially to Jeanette, for vacuuming the whole room.
