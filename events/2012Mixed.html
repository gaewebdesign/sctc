                 SCTC held its first tournament in many years on September 22-23.  
                 34 players in 3 divisions competed for the club mixed doubles title.  
                 It was a competitive tournament, but also designed to be fun, with a consolation draw, food, and a gift for all the players.
                 <p>
                 The 7.0 division was the smallest, with only three teams, so a round robin format was used. 
                 Emi Iuzuka and Hang Lee won both of their matches, and emerged as the 7.0 champions.
                 Runners-up were Luzmaria Martinez and Thomas Dunham.

                 The 8.0 division was the largest, with nine very competitive teams.   
                 The 8.0 champions were Jennifer Adams and Chetan Uttarkar, finalists were Angie Morey and Shawn Kim, and the 
                 consolation winners were Rachel Okazaki and Craig Kanetake.

                 There were five strong teams in the 9.0 division.  
                 Fiona Wong Prudhomme and Susumu Ueno emerged as the champions, Taryn Ishida and Matt Montana were the finalists
                 and Joy Lenz and Ray Chiu were the consolation winners.

                 The champions and finalists each received an SCTC embossed towel, and the participation gift was a drawstring bag
                 embossed with the club name.   Everyone appeared to have a great time.  The weather was beautiful,
                 there were many spectators on the bleachers to cheer on the teams, and there was plenty of food, 
                 fun and laughter. The club hopes to continue to have yearly tournaments, perhaps with men's and women's doubles/singles
                 as well as mixed.

                 The tournament committee consisted of Carrie Bell, Roger Okamoto, Taryn Ishida and Helen Matsumoto.  
                 Jeanette Hoggatt, Luzmaria Martinez and Marshall Madamba also assisted.
