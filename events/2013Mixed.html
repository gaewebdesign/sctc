<b><u>September 7/8 Mixed Doubles Tournament!</u></b><br>
-->
<p>
Santa Clara Tennis Club hosted a Mixed Doubles Tournament on September 7. It was supposed to be a two day tournament like last year, but due to low attendance we fit it all into one day.  The day was hot,hot,hot and we had a total of 8 teams, 4 teams for each flight.   One 8.0 team showed up without their partner but quickly picked up a player on the courts!  We had some really nice matches and very long points.  Thanks to all the teams for participating.
