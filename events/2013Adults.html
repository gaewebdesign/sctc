On July 13/14 SCTC held a member and guest doubles tournament.  Some entered for fun, others to prepare for adult league playoffs. 
There were competitive matches for all levels as there was a full consolation round and at least two matches guaranteed for everyone.  The cost was a nominal $20 for SCTC members, $25 for guests. Results and participant pictures are below.
